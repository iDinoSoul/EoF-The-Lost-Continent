# eof-the-lost-continent
A new DLC datapack to be used in conjunction with the main Elytras of Fire datapack! This add-on features 3 new tribes, each with 3 new abilities.

How to Install:
1. Download the datapack (Clone or download -> Download ZIP)
2. Open the Minecraft world folder, then the "datapacks" folder (Main menu -> Singleplayer -> Select a world, then edit -> Open World Folder -> datapacks).
3. In the folder you just downloaded is another folder called "eof-the-lost-continent-master," and inside that is "the-lost-continent." Drag that folder into the "datapacks" folder in your world folder.
4. If you are already logged into your world, type /reload. If this does not show a welcome message, type /datapack enable "file/the-lost-continent" first, then do /reload.
5. Done!
