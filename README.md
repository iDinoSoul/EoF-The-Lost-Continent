# EoF: The Lost Continent
This Minecraft datapack aims to recreate the world of "Wings of Fire" by author Tui T. Sutherland in-game!

How to Install:

1. Download the datapack (Clone or download -> Download ZIP)
2. Open your 1.16.X Minecraft world folder, then the "datapacks" folder (Main menu -> Singleplayer -> Select a world, then click Edit -> Open World Folder -> datapacks).
3. Unzip the .zip you downloaded. You should now have a folder called "EoF-The-Lost-Continent-master," and inside of that is a folder titled "the-lost-continent". Drag the "the-lost-continent" folder into the "datapacks" folder in your world.
4. Regardless of if you are already logged into your world or not, log into your world and/or type "/reload". If this does not show the welcome message, type /datapack enable "file/the-lost-continent" first, then enter in /reload.
5. You're done! Enjoy the EoF: The Lost Continent datapack!
